The Dojo Android SDK lets you build a simple and intuitive payment experience in your Android mobile app.
Our default theme comes in both light and dark modes, right out of the box, which your users will love! What's more, you can customize the UI screens and add more elements to collect payment details.

## Requirements

Android version **5.0** and later.

## Installation

To setup our Android Dojo SDK, you must add the required dependencies. Check out our [setup guide 🔧](https://docs.dojo.tech/payments/mobile-integration/android/android-setup) to get started.

## Accept payments

Once you've installed and setup the Dojo Android SDK, you can configure your app to start [accepting payments 💳](https://docs.dojo.tech/payments/mobile-integration/android/android-accept-payments).

## Save card

You can provide your mobile app users with the ability to [save their card information](https://docs.dojo.tech/payments/mobile-integration/android/accept-payments/android-save-card) securely for future use.
The following is an example of this feature.
